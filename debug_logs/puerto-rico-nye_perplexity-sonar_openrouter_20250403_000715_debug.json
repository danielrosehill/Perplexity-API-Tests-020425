        "content": "On New Year's Eve, December 31, 2024, a massive power outage severely disrupted celebrations across Puerto Rico, leaving nearly 90% of the island's residents without electricity. Here are the details of what happened:\n\n### Cause of the Outage\nThe blackout was primarily caused by the **failure of an underground power line**, according to Luma Energy, the company responsible for Puerto Rico's electricity transmission and distribution[1][2][3]. This incident was not isolated but part of a broader context of chronic power outages and infrastructure issues.\n\n### Impact\n- **Number Affected**: Over 1.3 million customers lost power, which equates to about 90% of Luma's 1.47 million clients[1][2][3].\n- **Restoration Efforts**: Power was restored to about half of those affected within 24 hours, with the entire effort taking approximately two days to complete[1][3].\n- **Challenges**: The outage resulted in widespread disruptions, with many businesses, parks, and malls forced to close. Some essential services, like hospitals and the water and sewer company, had power restored sooner[3][4].\n\n### Background and Reactions\n- **Infrastructure Issues**: Puerto Rico's power grid has been in decline for years, exacerbated by a lack of maintenance and investment. The situation worsened significantly after **Hurricane Maria** in 2017, which severely damaged the grid[1][2][4].\n- **Recent Repairs**: Permanent repairs to the grid only began recently, with temporary fixes in place for many years. Residents continue to rely on aging generators provided by FEMA[2][4].\n- **Public and Government Response**: The blackout fueled anger against Luma Energy and Genera PR, with many calling for their ouster. Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n has threatened to revoke Luma's contract and proposed using more fossil fuels, suggesting that renewable energy targets are unrealistic[2][3][4].\n\nOverall, the New Year's Eve blackout highlighted the ongoing struggles with Puerto Rico's power infrastructure and the need for significant improvements to prevent future disruptions.",
