        "content": "Puerto Rico faced a catastrophic power outage on December 31, 2024, plunging approximately 1.3 million customers (90% of the island) into darkness just hours before New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations[1][4][6]. The blackout began at dawn when an underground power line failed near the southern coast, triggering a cascading collapse of the grid that shut down multiple power plants[1][5][7]. Luma Energy, the private operator of Puerto Rico\u2019s transmission and distribution system, reported partial restoration within 24 hours and full recovery after two days[1][7].\n\n**Root Causes and Context**  \nThe immediate failure stemmed from aging infrastructure, with the underground line breakdown exposing systemic vulnerabilities. However, the crisis had deeper roots:  \n- **Post-Hurricane Maria fragility**: The grid had relied on temporary fixes since 2017\u2019s Category 4 Hurricane Maria, with permanent repairs only beginning recently[1][6].  \n- **Chronic underinvestment**: Decades of neglected maintenance left equipment outdated and prone to failure[4][6].  \n- **Generator dependency**: Hospitals and critical facilities still relied on FEMA-provided generators from the Maria recovery[3][6].  \n\n**Political Fallout**  \nThe outage intensified public anger toward Luma Energy and Genera PR (the generation operator), with protests demanding contract cancellations[3][5]. Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n called for an \"energy czar\" to review Luma\u2019s operations and proposed abandoning Puerto Rico\u2019s 100% renewable energy by 2050 goal in favor of natural gas[3][6]. Current Governor Pedro Pierluisi demanded expedited repairs and federal assistance, which President Biden authorized through Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm[2][7].\n\n**Impact on Residents**  \n- Celebrations were canceled as businesses, parks, and malls closed[4][6].  \n- Diabetics and medically vulnerable individuals faced heightened risks without refrigeration or AC[4].  \n- Many resorted to candles, gas stoves, and generators, highlighting economic disparities[4][6].  \n\nThis outage underscored Puerto Rico\u2019s ongoing energy crisis, with experts warning that full grid stabilization could take years and billions in investment[1][7]. The event became a flashpoint for debates about privatization, climate resilience, and equitable infrastructure development in the U.S. territory.",

        "reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what happened in Puerto Rico on New Year's Eve 2024 that disrupted the celebrations. The user is asking for details about the cause. Let me check the search results provided.\n\nLooking at the sources, most of them mention a massive power outage. Source [1] says 90% of Puerto Rico lost power due to an underground power line failure. That seems significant. Source [2] and [3] also talk about the blackout affecting over a million customers. The cause mentioned in [1], [3], [4], and [6] is the failure of an underground line. There's a pattern here. \n\nWait, some sources also mention the broader context of the power grid's issues after Hurricane Maria in 2017. Source [1] and [6] explain that the grid was already fragile from years of neglect and temporary fixes post-Maria. The outage wasn't just a one-time thing but part of ongoing problems. \n\nGovernor-elect Jennifer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n's response is in [3] and [6], where she threatened to revoke Luma Energy's contract and proposed using more fossil fuels. That's an interesting angle on the political and energy policy aspects. \n\nSources [7] and [5] mention the restoration process, taking up to two days, and the cascading effect from the initial line failure. Also, the impact on residents' celebrations is in [4], with people struggling without power. \n\nI should structure the answer to first explain the outage, then the immediate cause (the power line failure), then the underlying issues with the grid, and the political reactions. Make sure to cite the sources for each point. Also, note the frustration from residents and the federal response mentioned in [2] and [7].\n"
