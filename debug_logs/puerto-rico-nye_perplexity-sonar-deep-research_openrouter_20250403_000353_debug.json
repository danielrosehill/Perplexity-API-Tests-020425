        "content": "A massive power outage struck Puerto Rico on December 31, 2024, disrupting New Year's Eve celebrations and leaving over 1.3 million customers (90% of the island) without electricity[1][3][4]. The blackout began at 5:30 AM local time when an underground power line failed at the Costa Sur power plant in southern Puerto Rico, triggering a cascading collapse of the grid that forced multiple power plants offline[7][11][15]. LUMA Energy \u2013 the private operator managing transmission and distribution \u2013 warned restoration could take 24-48 hours[5][8], though partial service returned to 700,000 customers by midnight[1][4].\n\n### Key Details of the Outage  \n**Immediate Cause**:  \n- A critical fault in an underground 230 kV transmission line at Costa Sur, one of Puerto Rico's largest power plants[11][15]  \n- Cascade effect from the initial failure caused synchronized shutdowns at Aguirre (550 MW lost) and other plants[11][13]  \n\n**Impact**:  \n- 16 hospitals initially without power, though some regained partial service[1][4]  \n- Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport switched to backup generators[13]  \n- Water pumps failed in some areas, threatening supply[8][12]  \n- Businesses and government agencies closed early, canceling celebrations[3][6][12]  \n\n**Response**:  \n- LUMA activated emergency protocols but faced public backlash for slow communication[6][9][12]  \n- Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n threatened to revoke LUMA's contract and proposed abandoning renewable energy targets[10][12]  \n- White House offered federal assistance, with President Biden coordinating aid[14]  \n\n### Underlying Grid Vulnerabilities  \nThe outage exposed systemic weaknesses in Puerto Rico's energy infrastructure:  \n\n| Factor | Impact |  \n|--------|--------|  \n| Post-Hurricane Maria damage (2017) | Grid remains heavily dependent on temporary FEMA generators[9][12] |  \n| Underinvestment | 60% of power still comes from aging petroleum plants[10][12] |  \n| Renewable transition delays | Only 3-5% renewable penetration by 2023 vs. 40% target for 2025[2][10] |  \n| Debt crisis | $9 billion PREPA debt limits modernization efforts[9][12] |  \n\nLUMA partially restored power by January 2, but faced secondary failures at Aguirre plant on New Year's Day that left 600,000 customers without electricity again[11]. The company urged energy conservation due to ongoing generation shortfalls, revealing the grid's fragility despite $12.8 billion in federal recovery funds allocated since 2020[2][11].  \n\nThis blackout marked Puerto Rico's worst power crisis since Hurricane Fiona (2022), reigniting debates about privatization and energy policy[7][9]. With only 7% of electricity from solar despite abundant sunshine[12], the incident underscored the challenges of balancing renewable goals against immediate reliability needs.",

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this query about the power outage in Puerto Rico on New Year's Eve 2024. The user wants detailed information on what happened and the cause.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the provided search results to get an overview. Most sources mention a massive blackout affecting nearly all of Puerto Rico on December 31, 2024. The numbers vary slightly, but around 1.3 million customers were left without power, which is about 90% of the population. The timing during New Year's Eve made it particularly disruptive.\n\nLooking for the cause, several articles point to an underground power line failure. For example, results [3], [6], [9], and [13] mention a failure in an underground line at the Costa Sur plant, which triggered a cascade effect. This seems to be the primary cause. However, some sources like [11] and [15] provide more technical details about the cascade effect causing multiple power plants to shut down.\n\nI need to note the response from LUMA Energy, the company managing the grid. They acknowledged the issue and worked on restoration, but faced criticism. The political angle is also important\u2014governor-elect Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n's response and calls for an energy czar are mentioned in [10] and [12].\n\nThe historical context is crucial. Puerto Rico's grid has been fragile since Hurricane Maria in 2017, and ongoing issues with maintenance and underinvestment are highlighted in sources like [2] and [9]. The reliance on FEMA generators and the slow transition to renewables (Act 17) are factors contributing to the vulnerability.\n\nRestoration efforts took longer than expected, with some sources [11] indicating that even after partial restoration, another failure occurred on January 1st. By January 2nd, most customers had power back, but the system remained fragile.\n\nI should structure the answer to first outline the event, then the cause, followed by the response and restoration efforts, and finally the broader context of Puerto Rico's energy challenges. Citations need to be properly attributed, using the most relevant sources for each section. Make sure to mention the impact on New Year's celebrations, the technical cause, the company's role, political reactions, and the historical grid issues.\n"
