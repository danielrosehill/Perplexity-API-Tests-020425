        "content": "The relationship between income inequality and access to healthcare in developed countries is complex, with evidence suggesting that higher income levels often lead to better access to certain healthcare services. Here are key findings based on empirical data:\n\n## Income Inequality and General Practitioner Visits\nIn many OECD countries, general practitioner (GP) visits are distributed equitably across income groups, and sometimes even favor lower-income individuals, particularly when financial barriers are reduced through mechanisms like copayment exemptions or reduced rates[1][5]. However, there are exceptions, such as Finland, where some inequity exists due to occupational and private healthcare arrangements[1].\n\n## Specialist Care Access Inequality\nIn contrast to GP visits, access to specialist care shows significant pro-rich inequity in almost all developed countries. People with higher incomes are more likely to see specialists and do so more frequently than those with lower incomes. This pattern is consistent across countries, including those with universal healthcare systems and those with private options[1][5]. For example, countries like Finland, Portugal, and Ireland exhibit substantial pro-rich inequity in specialist care[1][5].\n\n## Role of Internet Access in Reducing Inequality\nInternet access can mitigate the negative impact of income inequality on healthcare access by providing better access to health information and resources[2]. Studies have shown that increased Internet penetration improves overall health conditions and reduces health inequality by facilitating access to necessary health services across different income groups[2].\n\n## Structural Inequities and Social Determinants\nBeyond financial access, structural inequities and social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic status, play critical roles in shaping health outcomes. These factors contribute to disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes, reinforcing the need for policies addressing these underlying issues[4]. For instance, income inequality affects health through multiple mechanisms, including the ability to afford healthcare services and healthy lifestyles[4].\n\nIn summary, while general healthcare access is often equitable in developed countries, specialist care access and overall health outcomes remain significantly influenced by income, with higher-income individuals generally having better access to specialized services. The role of Internet access in improving healthcare equity highlights the potential for digital solutions to mitigate income-related disparities in healthcare access."
