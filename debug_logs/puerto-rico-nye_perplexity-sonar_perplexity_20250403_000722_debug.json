        "content": "On December 31, 2024, a massive power outage disrupted New Year's celebrations across nearly the entire island of Puerto Rico. Here are the details of what happened and the causes behind the disruption:\n\n## Overview of the Outage\n- **Impact**: The blackout affected about 90% of Puerto Rico, leaving more than 1.3 million customers without power, including nearly 90% of Luma Energy's 1.47 million clients[1][2][3].\n- **Timing**: The outage occurred early in the morning on New Year's Eve, resulting in widespread disruptions to daily activities and celebrations[3][5].\n\n## Cause of the Outage\n- **Immediate Cause**: The primary reason cited for the power outage was the failure of an underground power line[1][2][4].\n- **Underlying Issues**: The incident highlighted Puerto Rico's chronic power grid challenges, exacerbated by years of neglect and insufficient investment[1][4].\n- **Historical Context**: The island's power infrastructure has been in decline for years, further damaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Despite recent efforts to begin permanent repairs, the grid remains fragile[1][2].\n\n## Response and Restoration\n- **Restoration Efforts**: Power restoration was expected to take up to 48 hours, with some areas getting power back within 24 hours[2][5]. By the evening of December 31, 2024, over 336,000 clients, including hospitals, had their power restored[3].\n- **Public Reaction**: The blackout intensified public dissatisfaction with Luma Energy and Genera PR, leading to calls for their removal and demands for better power management solutions[2][3].\n\n## Political Response\n- **Governor-Elect Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n**: Announced plans to create an \"energy czar\" to oversee contractual breaches and explore alternative power operators. She also suggested revising Puerto Rico's renewable energy targets to use more fossil fuels for reliability[2][3].\n- **Current Governor Pedro Pierluisi**: Engaged with both companies to demand swift solutions and restoration efforts[3][4]."
