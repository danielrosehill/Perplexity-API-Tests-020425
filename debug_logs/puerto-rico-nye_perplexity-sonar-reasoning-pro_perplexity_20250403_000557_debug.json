        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query about the New Year's Eve power outage in Puerto Rico in 2024. The user wants to know what happened and the cause of the disruption with as much detail as possible. \n\nFirst, I need to go through all the search results provided. Let me start by skimming each source to get an overview. \n\nSearch result [1] mentions that 90% of Puerto Rico lost power due to a failure of an underground power line. It also points out long-term infrastructure issues stemming from Hurricane Maria in 2017 and ongoing maintenance problems. There's mention of political reactions, like the governor-elect calling for an energy czar. \n\nResult [2] is from ABC News, dated 2024-12-31, stating that an island-wide blackout left over a million without power. It notes that LUMA Energy was investigating the cause and that President Biden offered federal assistance. Also, previous outages in 2020, 2021, and 2022 are mentioned, showing a pattern of issues.\n\nResult [3] from san.com provides similar details about the outage affecting 1.3 million customers and the underground line failure. It adds that the governor-elect threatened to revoke LUMA's contract and proposed using more fossil fuels instead of renewable energy targets.\n\nResult [4] from MPR News gives a personal touch with quotes from residents affected by the blackout. It confirms the cause as an underground line failure and mentions the estimated restoration time of 24-48 hours. It also highlights the aging infrastructure and reliance on FEMA generators.\n\nResult [5] is a YouTube video transcript from NBC News. It reiterates the underground cable failure causing a cascading effect on power plants. Frustration among residents is evident, and the timeline for restoration was uncertain.\n\nResult [6] by Fox5NY emphasizes the political responses, including Governor-elect Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n's call for an energy czar and the current governor's communication with LUMA and Genera PR. It also notes the use of FEMA generators and the debt issues of the power authority.\n\nResult [7] from CBS News gives an update that power was mostly restored by January 1, 2025. It explains the cascading failure starting at the Costa Sur plant and mentions ongoing investigations. The fragility of the grid and the need for rotating outages are highlighted.\n\nResults [8], [9], and [10] don't seem relevant to the query. [8] is about climate risks in transportation, [9] is a video link without new info, and [10] discusses Alzheimer's disease, which is unrelated.\n\nSynthesizing the info: The immediate cause was an underground power line failure at the Costa Sur plant, leading to cascading failures. Long-term causes include infrastructure degradation since Hurricane Maria, lack of maintenance, and underinvestment. Political reactions included calls for contract reviews and shifting energy policies. Restoration took about two days, but the grid remains fragile.\n\nI need to structure the answer with an overview, causes (immediate and systemic), impact, responses, and ongoing challenges. Citations should be from the relevant sources, mainly [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Make sure to mention the number affected, dates, causes, political actions, and restoration efforts.\n</think>\n\nA massive power outage struck Puerto Rico on December 31, 2024, plunging approximately **1.3 million customers** (90% of the island) into darkness just hours before New Year's Eve celebrations[1][2][3]. The outage lasted up to 48 hours for some areas, with full restoration achieved by January 2, 2025[7][6].  \n\n### Key Details of the Blackout  \n**Immediate Cause**  \n- A critical failure occurred in an **underground power line** near the Costa Sur power plant in southern Puerto Rico[1][5][7].  \n- This triggered a cascading failure that shut down multiple power plants across the island, including those operated by Genera PR[7][6].  \n\n**Systemic Vulnerabilities**  \n- Puerto Rico's grid has suffered from **decades of underinvestment**, with most infrastructure relying on temporary repairs from 2017's Hurricane Maria[1][4][6].  \n- 60% of the island\u2019s energy still comes from aging petroleum-powered plants, with only 7% from solar power[6].  \n- The grid collapse exposed dependence on **FEMA-provided generators** meant for emergency use, which Puerto Rico requested to extend through 2026[3][6].  \n\n### Impact and Response  \n- Hospitals, water plants, and businesses closed temporarily, forcing residents to rely on generators and candles[4][6].  \n- LUMA Energy (transmission operator) restored power to 98% within 48 hours but warned of **rotating outages** due to grid fragility[7].  \n- Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n threatened to revoke LUMA\u2019s contract and proposed abandoning Puerto Rico\u2019s 2050 renewable energy target to prioritize fossil fuels[3][6].  \n\n### Long-Term Challenges  \nThe outage highlighted:  \n1. **Political tensions**: Calls for an \u201cenergy czar\u201d to oversee grid reforms[1][6].  \n2. **Financial instability**: The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority struggles with $9B debt[6].  \n3. **Climate vulnerability**: Hurricane Maria\u2019s legacy and inadequate disaster preparedness[1][4].  \n\nThis event marked the **worst blackout since Hurricane Fiona in 2022**, underscoring systemic failures in infrastructure management and energy policy[2][7]."
