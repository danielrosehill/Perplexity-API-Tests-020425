## Prompt
Explain the relationship between income inequality and access to healthcare in developed countries. Support each statement with citations to peer-reviewed studies containing relevant statistical data. Your explanation must be based solely on empirically verifiable data.

## Output
The relationship between income inequality and healthcare access in developed countries reveals systemic inequities, particularly in specialist care and financial protection. Here’s a synthesis of empirical findings:

### **1. Pro-Rich Inequity in Specialist Access**  
In OECD countries, higher-income individuals face fewer barriers to specialist care, even after accounting for health needs. Studies using need-standardized visits show significant pro-rich inequity in specialist access:  
- **United States and Mexico** exhibit the highest inequity, followed by **Finland, Portugal, and Sweden**[1][5].  
- **Private healthcare options** (e.g., in Finland, Portugal) exacerbate disparities, but inequities persist even in systems with general practitioner (GP) gatekeepers (e.g., Denmark, Norway)[1].  

GP visits, by contrast, are often equitably distributed or favor lower-income groups due to policies like copayment exemptions[1][5].  

### **2. Income Inequality and Health Outcomes**  
Income disparities correlate with life expectancy gaps:  
- A study analyzing 1.4 billion U.S. tax records found a **14.6-year gap in life expectancy** between the top 1% and bottom 1% of earners for men, and **10.1 years** for women[4].  
- Mechanisms include reduced access to preventive care, healthy living conditions, and chronic stress from financial hardship[4].  

### **3. Financial Barriers in Universal Systems**  
Even in developed nations with universal coverage, financial costs create inequities:  
- **800 million people globally spend ≥10% of household income on health expenses**, with 100 million pushed into extreme poverty[3].  
- Within-country disparities persist: in low-income countries, **only 17% of the poorest fifth receive six basic maternal/child interventions**, versus **74% of the wealthiest fifth**[3].  

### **4. Mitigating Role of Internet Access**  
Internet penetration reduces health inequality by improving access to information and services:  
- Cross-country analyses show **internet access mitigates income inequality’s negative impact on healthcare access**, particularly in developed economies[2].

**Key Data Points**  
| **Aspect**                | **Finding**                                                                 | **Source** |  
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|  
| **Specialist Access**      | Pro-rich inequity highest in U.S., Mexico, Finland, Portugal, Sweden[1][5]   | [1][5]     |  
| **Life Expectancy Gap**   | 14.6-year gap (men) / 10.1-year gap (women) between richest/poorest 1%[4]    | [4]        |  
| **Financial Hardship**    | 800 million spend ≥10% income on health; 100 million pushed to extreme poverty[3] | [3]        |  
| **Internet’s Role**       | Reduces health inequality by improving access and mitigating income effects[2] | [2]        |  

These findings underscore that structural inequities—driven by income gradients and healthcare system design—persist even in high-income countries, necessitating policies to address both access and financial protection.
