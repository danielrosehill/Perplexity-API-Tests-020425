## Prompt
I heard that New Year's celebrations in Puerto Rico were severely disrupted on New Years Eve (December 31, 2024). What happened? Provide as many details as possible about the cause of the disruption.

## Output
On New Year's Eve 2024, Puerto Rico experienced a massive power outage that left approximately 90% of the island in darkness, severely disrupting celebrations. Over 1.3 million customers, out of the island's 1.47 million, were affected. The blackout began early in the morning at 5:30 a.m. local time and was attributed to the failure of an underground power line. This failure caused a cascading effect on the island's power grid, leading to widespread outages across other plants and systems[1][2][6].

The incident highlighted the fragility of Puerto Rico's aging power infrastructure, which has suffered from decades of neglect and underinvestment. The situation has been exacerbated by the devastating impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017, which severely damaged the island's power grid. Despite some recent efforts to make permanent repairs, much of the system remains reliant on temporary fixes and aging equipment. Chronic power outages have become a recurring issue, fueling public frustration with Luma Energy, the company responsible for electricity transmission and distribution, and Genera PR, which oversees power generation[1][2][3].

The disruption not only dampened New Year's celebrations but also resulted in significant inconveniences such as the closure of businesses and government agencies. Restoration efforts began promptly, with power returning to most customers within two days. However, the event has intensified calls for major energy reforms, with Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón advocating for a reevaluation of Luma Energy's contract and proposing changes to the island's energy policies, including a shift toward more fossil fuel use instead of the current goal of 100% renewable energy by 2050[1][3][7].

This blackout underscores the persistent challenges Puerto Rico faces in modernizing its power grid and ensuring reliable energy for its residents.
