## Prompt
I heard that New Year's celebrations in Puerto Rico were severely disrupted on New Years Eve (December 31, 2024). What happened? Provide as many details as possible about the cause of the disruption.

## Output
A massive power outage struck Puerto Rico on December 31, 2024, disrupting New Year's Eve celebrations and leaving over 1.3 million customers (90% of the island) without electricity[1][3][4]. The blackout began at 5:30 AM local time when an underground power line failed at the Costa Sur power plant in southern Puerto Rico, triggering a cascading collapse of the grid that forced multiple power plants offline[7][11][15]. LUMA Energy – the private operator managing transmission and distribution – warned restoration could take 24-48 hours[5][8], though partial service returned to 700,000 customers by midnight[1][4].

### Key Details of the Outage  
**Immediate Cause**:  
- A critical fault in an underground 230 kV transmission line at Costa Sur, one of Puerto Rico's largest power plants[11][15]  
- Cascade effect from the initial failure caused synchronized shutdowns at Aguirre (550 MW lost) and other plants[11][13]  

**Impact**:  
- 16 hospitals initially without power, though some regained partial service[1][4]  
- Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport switched to backup generators[13]  
- Water pumps failed in some areas, threatening supply[8][12]  
- Businesses and government agencies closed early, canceling celebrations[3][6][12]  

**Response**:  
- LUMA activated emergency protocols but faced public backlash for slow communication[6][9][12]  
- Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón threatened to revoke LUMA's contract and proposed abandoning renewable energy targets[10][12]  
- White House offered federal assistance, with President Biden coordinating aid[14]  

### Underlying Grid Vulnerabilities  
The outage exposed systemic weaknesses in Puerto Rico's energy infrastructure:  

| Factor | Impact |  
|--------|--------|  
| Post-Hurricane Maria damage (2017) | Grid remains heavily dependent on temporary FEMA generators[9][12] |  
| Underinvestment | 60% of power still comes from aging petroleum plants[10][12] |  
| Renewable transition delays | Only 3-5% renewable penetration by 2023 vs. 40% target for 2025[2][10] |  
| Debt crisis | $9 billion PREPA debt limits modernization efforts[9][12] |  

LUMA partially restored power by January 2, but faced secondary failures at Aguirre plant on New Year's Day that left 600,000 customers without electricity again[11]. The company urged energy conservation due to ongoing generation shortfalls, revealing the grid's fragility despite $12.8 billion in federal recovery funds allocated since 2020[2][11].  

This blackout marked Puerto Rico's worst power crisis since Hurricane Fiona (2022), reigniting debates about privatization and energy policy[7][9]. With only 7% of electricity from solar despite abundant sunshine[12], the incident underscored the challenges of balancing renewable goals against immediate reliability needs.
