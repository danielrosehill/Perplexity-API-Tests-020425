## Prompt
I heard that New Year's celebrations in Puerto Rico were severely disrupted on New Years Eve (December 31, 2024). What happened? Provide as many details as possible about the cause of the disruption.

## Output
On New Year's Eve, December 31, 2024, a massive power outage severely disrupted celebrations across Puerto Rico, leaving nearly 90% of the island's residents without electricity. Here are the details of what happened:

### Cause of the Outage
The blackout was primarily caused by the **failure of an underground power line**, according to Luma Energy, the company responsible for Puerto Rico's electricity transmission and distribution[1][2][3]. This incident was not isolated but part of a broader context of chronic power outages and infrastructure issues.

### Impact
- **Number Affected**: Over 1.3 million customers lost power, which equates to about 90% of Luma's 1.47 million clients[1][2][3].
- **Restoration Efforts**: Power was restored to about half of those affected within 24 hours, with the entire effort taking approximately two days to complete[1][3].
- **Challenges**: The outage resulted in widespread disruptions, with many businesses, parks, and malls forced to close. Some essential services, like hospitals and the water and sewer company, had power restored sooner[3][4].

### Background and Reactions
- **Infrastructure Issues**: Puerto Rico's power grid has been in decline for years, exacerbated by a lack of maintenance and investment. The situation worsened significantly after **Hurricane Maria** in 2017, which severely damaged the grid[1][2][4].
- **Recent Repairs**: Permanent repairs to the grid only began recently, with temporary fixes in place for many years. Residents continue to rely on aging generators provided by FEMA[2][4].
- **Public and Government Response**: The blackout fueled anger against Luma Energy and Genera PR, with many calling for their ouster. Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón has threatened to revoke Luma's contract and proposed using more fossil fuels, suggesting that renewable energy targets are unrealistic[2][3][4].

Overall, the New Year's Eve blackout highlighted the ongoing struggles with Puerto Rico's power infrastructure and the need for significant improvements to prevent future disruptions.
