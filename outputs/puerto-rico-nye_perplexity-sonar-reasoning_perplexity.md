## Prompt
I heard that New Year's celebrations in Puerto Rico were severely disrupted on New Years Eve (December 31, 2024). What happened? Provide as many details as possible about the cause of the disruption.

## Output
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query about the New Year's Eve power outage in Puerto Rico. The user wants to know what happened, specifically the cause of the disruption. From the search results provided, there's a lot to process.

First, looking at the dates of the search results, they all point to events around December 31, 2024, and January 10, 2025. The key points from each source mention a massive blackout affecting about 90% of the island. The immediate cause cited by Luma Energy is the failure of an underground power line. But the search results also highlight deeper issues like chronic neglect, lack of maintenance, and lingering damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017.

I need to structure the answer clearly. Start with the immediate cause, then move into the underlying factors. The user wants as many details as possible, so I should include the scale of the outage (1.3 million customers, 90% affected), the timeline of restoration (24-48 hours), and the reactions from officials and residents.

Also important are the political responses: Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón proposing an "energy czar" and considering fossil fuels over renewable targets, and Governor Pedro Pierluisi demanding corrective measures. The infrastructure issues post-Maria, like temporary repairs and reliance on FEMA generators, are crucial context.

I should mention the public backlash against Luma and Genera PR, including social media criticism. The economic impact, such as closed businesses and cruise ships being affected, adds depth. Additionally, the ongoing debt of the Electric Power Authority and the mix of energy sources (mostly oil, some renewables) are relevant.

Need to ensure citations are correctly placed after each relevant fact. For example, when stating the cause as an underground line failure, cite [1][2][4]. When discussing Hurricane Maria's impact, cite [1][4]. Political responses should cite [1][2][3].

Avoid any markdown headers as per instructions, but use bold for subsections if needed. Keep paragraphs concise, each covering a specific aspect: immediate cause, underlying issues, official responses, public reaction, economic impact, etc.

Check that all key points from the search results are covered without redundancy. Make sure to mention the 100% renewable target by 2050 and González's proposal to drop some clean energy goals, citing [2][3][4].

Finally, conclude with the ongoing challenges and required investments, citing [1][4]. Ensure the answer flows logically from immediate incident to systemic problems and future implications.

A widespread power outage disrupted New Year's Eve celebrations in Puerto Rico on December 31, 2024, leaving approximately **1.3 million customers** (about 90% of the island) without electricity for up to 48 hours[1][2][4]. The immediate cause was identified as **a failure of an underground power line** by Luma Energy, the private operator of Puerto Rico’s transmission and distribution system[1][2][4]. However, this incident highlighted deeper systemic issues in the island’s energy infrastructure.

### **Root Causes and Systemic Issues**  
1. **Chronic Infrastructure Decay**: Puerto Rico’s power grid has suffered from **years of neglect**, inadequate maintenance, and delayed post-Hurricane Maria repairs. Temporary fixes from the 2017 storm had remained in place for seven years before permanent repairs began recently[1][4].  
2. **Hurricane Maria Legacy**: The Category 4 storm devastated the grid in 2017, but permanent repairs were only initiated in the years preceding 2024. The island still relies on aging FEMA-provided generators to stabilize the grid[1][4].  
3. **Overreliance on Fossil Fuels**: Despite a goal of **100% renewable energy by 2050**, Puerto Rico generates over 60% of its electricity from oil, with solar contributing only ~7%. Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón criticized these targets as unrealistic and proposed prioritizing natural gas for reliability[2][3][4].  

### **Immediate Impact and Responses**  
- **Restoration Timeline**: Power was restored to ~336,000 customers within 24 hours, including hospitals and critical infrastructure, but full recovery took up to two days[3][4].  
- **Political Backlash**:  
  - **Governor-elect González Colón** demanded the creation of an **“energy czar”** to investigate Luma’s contractual compliance and explore replacing the company[1][3].  
  - **Governor Pedro Pierluisi** pressured Luma and Genera PR (the power generation operator) to expedite repairs and provide transparency[1][3][4].  
- **Public Anger**: Residents vented frustration on social media, criticizing Luma and Genera PR for chronic outages and unreliable service[2][3][4].  

### **Economic and Social Consequences**  
- **Business Disruptions**: Malls, parks, and government agencies closed, while short-term rentals without generators faced cancellations. Cruise ships docking that day advised passengers to verify operational status[3][4].  
- **Health and Safety Risks**: Diabetics and others reliant on medical equipment reported challenges, with some forced to ration generator use[5].  

### **Long-Term Challenges**  
Puerto Rico’s grid remains fragile due to underinvestment, outdated infrastructure, and unresolved debt (e.g., the Electric Power Authority’s **$9 billion debt**)[4]. Full recovery is projected to take years, contingent on sustained funding and hurricane resilience[1][4]. The outage underscores the tension between renewable energy ambitions and immediate reliability needs, with political leaders divided on solutions[2][3].
