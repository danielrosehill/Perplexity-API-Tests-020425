## Prompt
I heard that New Year's celebrations in Puerto Rico were severely disrupted on New Years Eve (December 31, 2024). What happened? Provide as many details as possible about the cause of the disruption.

## Output

Okay, I need to figure out what happened in Puerto Rico on New Year's Eve 2024 that disrupted the celebrations. The user is asking for details about the cause and the event itself. Let me go through the search results provided.

First, looking at the dates on the search results, they're all from December 31, 2024, or January 1, 2025, which makes sense since the event happened on New Year's Eve. The main issue seems to be a massive power outage. Multiple sources mention a blackout affecting nearly all of Puerto Rico. Let me check the details.

From result [1], it says there was a blackout affecting over 1.2 million residents. Luma Energy reported 1.47 million clients had service disruptions. The cause wasn't clear initially, but it's tied to ongoing grid issues since Hurricane Maria in 2017.

Result [2] states the outage began at dawn, affecting 1.3 million clients. Luma Energy mentioned a failure in an underground power line. There's also mention of political reactions, like the governor-elect proposing an "energy czar."

Result [3] and [6] both describe the outage starting at dawn, plunging the island into silence. Some people were upset, like Manuel who was celebrating his birthday. Luma Energy again cites the underground line failure.

Result [4] and [14] add that the outage started at 5:30 AM local time, with less than 10% restored by afternoon. The White House got involved, offering federal help. The cause was under investigation, but the grid's fragility post-Hurricane Maria is a factor.

Result [5] and [10] talk about the impact on tourism and businesses, with hotels using generators. The governor-elect threatened to revoke Luma's contract and shift to more fossil fuels, which contradicts renewable goals.

Result [9] mentions that power was restored to 98% by the next day, but temporary outages were expected. The cause was confirmed as an underground line failure. Governor-elect Gonzalez-Colon urged energy conservation.

Result [15] is a PDF about Hurricane Maria's impact, which provides background on why the grid is so fragile. Result [16] discusses Puerto Rico's renewable energy goals and current struggles, with only 3-5% renewable energy as of 2023.

Putting this together: The main disruption was a massive blackout caused by an underground power line failure. The grid's vulnerability from past hurricanes and underinvestment made the outage widespread. Political responses included calls for restructuring energy management. Restoration took a couple of days, with federal assistance. The outage affected celebrations, closed businesses, and highlighted ongoing energy issues.

Puerto Rico experienced a devastating island-wide blackout on December 31, 2024, plunging 1.47 million utility customers (over 90% of the population) into darkness just hours before New Year's Eve celebrations[1][3][6]. The outage began at 5:30 AM local time when an underground transmission line failed in southern Puerto Rico, triggering cascading failures across the fragile grid[2][7][9].

### Key Details of the Crisis:
- **Immediate Impact**:  
  - The outage silenced cities as air conditioners and appliances shut off, with only generator-equipped households/businesses maintaining power[3][6].  
  - Hospitals, water facilities, and emergency services scrambled to activate backup systems[8].  
  - Tourism revenue collapsed as hotels limited amenities and San Juan’s festivities were canceled[1][5].  

- **Grid Vulnerabilities**:  
  The collapse exposed systemic weaknesses stemming from:  
  - **Hurricane Maria (2017)**: Destroyed 80% of transmission lines, with permanent repairs still ongoing[15][16].  
  - **Aging Infrastructure**: 60% reliance on petroleum-fired plants and 7% solar energy, with frequent outages since 2020 earthquakes and Hurricane Fiona (2022)[4][14].  
  - **Financial Crisis**: PREPA (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority) struggles with $9B debt and delayed modernization[2][16].  

- **Response Efforts**:  
  - Luma Energy restored 98% of power by January 1, 2025, but warned of rotating outages due to grid instability[9].  
  - The Biden administration deployed federal resources, including FEMA generators, while Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón proposed appointing an "energy czar" to overhaul utility contracts[2][9][10].  

### Political Fallout:  
  - Public anger surged against Luma Energy and Genera PR, with protests demanding their removal[6][10].  
  - González Colón advocated abandoning Puerto Rico’s 2050 renewable energy target to prioritize fossil fuel reliability, citing unrealistic clean energy timelines[10][16].  

The blackout underscored a decade of energy neglect, costing businesses millions and leaving residents facing a 20% electricity rate hike approved weeks earlier[9][16]. While power was largely restored within 48 hours, the incident intensified debates over privatizing utilities versus public grid investment.
