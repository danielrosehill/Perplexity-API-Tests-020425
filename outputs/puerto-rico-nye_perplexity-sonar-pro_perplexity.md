## Prompt
I heard that New Year's celebrations in Puerto Rico were severely disrupted on New Years Eve (December 31, 2024). What happened? Provide as many details as possible about the cause of the disruption.

## Output
New Year’s Eve celebrations in Puerto Rico on December 31, 2024, were severely disrupted by a massive island-wide power outage. The blackout, which began early that day, left more than 1.3 million customers—approximately 90% of the island—without electricity, plunging much of Puerto Rico into darkness during one of the most festive periods of the year[1][2][4].

### Cause of the Power Outage
The outage was reportedly triggered by the failure of an underground power line near the southern coast of the island. This failure had a cascading effect on the power grid, causing multiple power plants, including those managed by Genera PR, to go offline. This "waterfall effect" magnified the outage's impact, leaving nearly the entire island without electricity[1][3][7]. Luma Energy, which oversees electricity transmission and distribution in Puerto Rico, stated that the incident was under investigation, but the fragile state of the island’s power grid and lack of maintenance were contributing factors[3][6].

### Broader Context
Puerto Rico's power grid has been in a precarious state for years due to underinvestment, neglect, and extensive damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Despite ongoing efforts to make permanent repairs, much of the infrastructure remains vulnerable to large-scale failures[1][3][5]. Chronic power outages have been a persistent issue since the hurricane, and this latest event intensified public frustration with Luma Energy and Genera PR, the entities responsible for the island’s power generation and distribution[3][7].

### Impact of the Blackout
The blackout disrupted New Year’s Eve celebrations, forcing many events to be canceled or scaled back. Residents faced challenges such as a lack of air conditioning, lighting, and functioning appliances, with those who could afford generators relying on them for basic needs[4][6]. The outage also prompted widespread criticism of both private utility companies and the government for failing to address the island’s energy problems. Governor Pedro Pierluisi and Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón both demanded answers and corrective measures, with González-Colón threatening to revoke Luma Energy’s contract once in office[1][3][7].

### Restoration Efforts
Power restoration began gradually, with nearly half of the affected customers regaining electricity within 24 hours. Full restoration took approximately two days[1][7]. However, the incident underscored the ongoing fragility of Puerto Rico’s energy infrastructure, raising concerns over the territory’s ability to handle future outages or natural disasters.
