## Prompt
Explain the relationship between income inequality and access to healthcare in developed countries. Support each statement with citations to peer-reviewed studies containing relevant statistical data. Your explanation must be based solely on empirically verifiable data.

## Output
The relationship between income inequality and access to healthcare in developed countries is complex and multifaceted. Here's an analysis based on empirical data:

## Income Inequality and Healthcare Access

1. **Pro-Rich Inequity in Specialist Care**: In many developed countries, higher-income individuals are more likely to access specialist care compared to lower-income individuals. This is consistent across countries, even those with universal healthcare systems, such as Finland, Portugal, and Ireland[1][5]. For instance, after controlling for health needs, higher-income individuals are more likely to see specialists and do so more frequently than lower-income individuals[1].

2. **Equitable General Practitioner Visits**: In contrast to specialist care, visits to general practitioners are often distributed equitably across income groups, and in some cases, even favor the poor. This is partly due to policies like copayment exemptions or reduced rates for lower-income groups[1][5]. 

3. **Impact of Internet Access**: Internet access plays a significant role in mitigating the negative impact of income inequality on healthcare access. It improves overall health conditions and reduces health inequality by providing access to health information and resources[2].

4. **Structural Inequities**: Beyond income, structural inequities such as racism, sexism, and classism also affect healthcare access, leading to unfair and avoidable health disparities[4]. These systemic issues can exacerbate the effects of income inequality on healthcare access.

## Statistical Data and Trends

- **Life Expectancy and Income**: Studies have shown that higher income is associated with higher life expectancy, with significant gaps between the richest and poorest populations. For example, in the U.S., this gap was found to be as much as 14.6 years for men and 10.1 years for women[4].
  
- **Healthcare Utilization**: In countries like the U.S. and Mexico, without universal coverage, pro-rich inequity in doctor use is particularly pronounced[5]. In countries with universal coverage, such as Finland and Sweden, inequities exist primarily in specialist care access[1][5].

Overall, while developed countries strive for equitable healthcare access, income inequality continues to influence the distribution of healthcare services, particularly in specialist care. However, factors like Internet access and equitable policies for general practitioner visits help mitigate these disparities.
