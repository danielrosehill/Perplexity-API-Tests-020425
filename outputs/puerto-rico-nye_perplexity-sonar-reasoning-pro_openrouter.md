## Prompt
I heard that New Year's celebrations in Puerto Rico were severely disrupted on New Years Eve (December 31, 2024). What happened? Provide as many details as possible about the cause of the disruption.

## Output
Puerto Rico faced a catastrophic power outage on December 31, 2024, plunging approximately 1.3 million customers (90% of the island) into darkness just hours before New Year’s Eve celebrations[1][4][6]. The blackout began at dawn when an underground power line failed near the southern coast, triggering a cascading collapse of the grid that shut down multiple power plants[1][5][7]. Luma Energy, the private operator of Puerto Rico’s transmission and distribution system, reported partial restoration within 24 hours and full recovery after two days[1][7].

**Root Causes and Context**  
The immediate failure stemmed from aging infrastructure, with the underground line breakdown exposing systemic vulnerabilities. However, the crisis had deeper roots:  
- **Post-Hurricane Maria fragility**: The grid had relied on temporary fixes since 2017’s Category 4 Hurricane Maria, with permanent repairs only beginning recently[1][6].  
- **Chronic underinvestment**: Decades of neglected maintenance left equipment outdated and prone to failure[4][6].  
- **Generator dependency**: Hospitals and critical facilities still relied on FEMA-provided generators from the Maria recovery[3][6].  

**Political Fallout**  
The outage intensified public anger toward Luma Energy and Genera PR (the generation operator), with protests demanding contract cancellations[3][5]. Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón called for an "energy czar" to review Luma’s operations and proposed abandoning Puerto Rico’s 100% renewable energy by 2050 goal in favor of natural gas[3][6]. Current Governor Pedro Pierluisi demanded expedited repairs and federal assistance, which President Biden authorized through Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm[2][7].

**Impact on Residents**  
- Celebrations were canceled as businesses, parks, and malls closed[4][6].  
- Diabetics and medically vulnerable individuals faced heightened risks without refrigeration or AC[4].  
- Many resorted to candles, gas stoves, and generators, highlighting economic disparities[4][6].  

This outage underscored Puerto Rico’s ongoing energy crisis, with experts warning that full grid stabilization could take years and billions in investment[1][7]. The event became a flashpoint for debates about privatization, climate resilience, and equitable infrastructure development in the U.S. territory.
